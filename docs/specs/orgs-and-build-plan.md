# Implementation Plan: Organizations and Build Process

This document outlines the implementation plan for the organization data structure and build process changes.

## Overview

We will move from runtime data merging to build-time processing, which will:
1. Improve performance by eliminating runtime file operations
2. Reduce bundle size by not including source JSON files
3. Provide better type safety through build-time validation
4. Simplify runtime code by using pre-built data structures

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Structure Setup
- [ ] Create `/data` directory structure:
  ```
  /data
  ├── orgs.json              # Core organization data
  ├── models/               # Model definitions
  └── providers/           # Provider-specific data
  ```
- [ ] Move existing model data into the new structure
- [ ] Create initial `orgs.json` with core organization data
- [ ] Migrate existing provider data to new format

### 2. Build Process Implementation
- [ ] Create build script in `build/` directory
- [ ] Implement data collection:
  - Read `orgs.json`
  - Read all `providers/*.json` files
  - Read all `models/*.json` files
- [ ] Implement data merging:
  - Merge organization data with provider data
  - Resolve all relationships (creator/provider)
- [ ] Add data validation:
  - Check all relationships exist
  - Validate data consistency
  - Ensure required fields are present
- [ ] Generate optimized output:
  - Create TypeScript data structure
  - Save as `dist/data.ts`

### 3. Type Definitions
- [ ] Update existing types to match new structure
- [ ] Add build process types
- [ ] Add validation types
- [ ] Ensure proper type inference for pre-built data

### 4. Runtime Changes
- [ ] Modify `ModelCollection` to use pre-built data
- [ ] Remove runtime file reading
- [ ] Remove runtime data merging
- [ ] Update provider access methods
- [ ] Update creator access methods
- [ ] Update model access methods

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Add build process tests
- [ ] Add data validation tests
- [ ] Update existing model tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Test bundle size impact

## Dependencies

- TypeScript for type definitions and build process
- JSON validation for data consistency
- Build tools (tsc, etc.)

## Success Criteria

1. All tests pass
2. No runtime file operations
3. Smaller bundle size
4. Type safety maintained
5. Backward compatibility preserved
6. Build process completes successfully
7. Data validation catches errors

## Timeline

1. Data Structure Setup: 1 day
2. Build Process Implementation: 2 days
3. Type Definitions: 1 day
4. Runtime Changes: 2 days
5. Testing: 2 days

Total estimated time: 8 days

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Breaking changes for existing users
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility
   - **Mitigation**: Add migration guide

2. **Risk**: Build process complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Add comprehensive tests

3. **Risk**: Performance impact
   - **Mitigation**: Measure bundle size
   - **Mitigation**: Profile runtime performance

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve implementation plan
2. Set up data directory structure
3. Begin data migration
4. Start build process implementation
